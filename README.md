## Welcome to my repository of useless things

Code in this repository typically solves challenges found on various websites such as reddit, hackerrank, leetcode, and more. This primarily serves as a way to store my solutions for later use and for others to possibly learn from or use.
### Languages

Most challenges will be primarily coded in C, C#, or Java. However, if a challenge specifies a language other than the aforementioned, it will be used.

``` Challenges

1. Subfactorial
- The code supports subfactorial calculations for single digits. Ihis can easily be fixed, but I'm too lazy and the solution works. 
2. Ducci Sequence
- Calculates the Ducci sequence for an array. The code is specifically for a challenge where the target was to count how many steps would be required to reach a 0-tuple array (where all values in the array are zero).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/anthonydecenzo/challenges/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
